# Predicting-the-Probability-of-Forest-Fires-using-Weather-Data
Developing a model that can be trained and used for Forest Fires Prediction for certain day, month or a year.
The datebase about forest fires that was used in this project can be found in the open resource website:https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/v2/07e04fb0-9eaf-44fa-b064-7ac9856b2881/view?access_token=4c59dfbbf611086f25d77bd305057babed2d9c523645d57f67b0d98379a8e35f
finalprojectSVC is using the Linear Support Vector Classifier and finalprojectNB is using the Naive Bayes model. SVC is naturally more effective but it takes more than 15 minutes to calculate.
